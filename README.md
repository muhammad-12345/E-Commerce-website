# E-Commerce Project

## Overview

This project is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It includes three main components:

- **Frontend**: The user interface built with React.
- **Backend**: The server-side application using Express and Node.js.
- **Admin**: Admin panel for managing products and other administrative tasks.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `frontend/` - Contains the React application.
- `backend/` - Contains the Express server and related API routes.
- `admin/` - Contains the admin panel code (if applicable).
